The research aims to find out the related useful educational resources on Google when people input a keyword.
Programming using Python to automatically collect the resources related to the keyword, then pick out the carefully
chosen features for many keywords to form a large dataset, then train a random forest classifier based on the dataset,
which is later used to distinguish whether a collected resources is useful or not, and finally the program will return the
results based on the ranking and judgement of the classifier. The research is still on going.
